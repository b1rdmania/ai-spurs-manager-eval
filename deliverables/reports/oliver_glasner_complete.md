## 4 Spurs-Fit Breakdown  
**Front-Foot Play (16/25)** — PPDA 11.8 fails benchmark, npxGD +0.14 good, xG/shot 0.10 below threshold - mixed attacking metrics  
**Youth Development (4/25)** — 4% U23 minutes severely below minimum, 2 debuts inadequate - major weakness for Spurs philosophy  
**Talent Inflation (15/25)** — +£40M squad value moderate, £40M net spend reasonable but limited transformation scale  
**Big Games (25/25)** — 60% KO rate excellent, Big-8 record competitive considering Palace resources

## 5 Cultural & Board Fit  
Budget friction at Frankfurt suggests potential conflicts with resource constraints. Smoother relationship at Palace under Parish indicates adaptability. Professional approach but pragmatic rather than visionary - may clash with Spurs' long-term academy focus.

---

## 6 Big-Match Analysis  
5-7-3 vs PL top-8 shows tactical competence against elite opposition considering Palace's limitations. FA Cup run demonstrates knockout expertise and ability to prepare teams for big occasions. Europa League victory with Frankfurt highlights continental experience.

---

## 7 Financial Impact  
Squad value growth +£40M on moderate spend shows decent player development. Eze transformation (+£15M value) demonstrates ability to improve individual players. Limited sample size for major squad transformation projects.

---

## 8 Injury & Conditioning  
Squad availability 88% adequate but not exceptional. Uses compact training cycles and rotation policies. Fitness management competent but lacks innovative approaches seen in top-tier operations.

---

## 9 Summary & Recommendation  
Short-term trophy specialist with proven cup-winning credentials but fundamental misalignment with Spurs academy philosophy. Youth development metrics catastrophically poor for club's strategic direction. Suitable only if board prioritizes immediate silverware over sustainable development model.
