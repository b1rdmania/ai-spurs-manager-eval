## 1 Executive Snapshot  
Kieran McKenna is the meteoric 38-year-old who took Ipswich from League One to the Premier League in two seasons while posting the best attacking npxGD in the EFL. He checks every Spurs benchmark—front-foot PPDA, youth minutes, squad-value inflation—and his age-driven upside scores off the charts. Risk lies in zero Premier-League big-game sample.
