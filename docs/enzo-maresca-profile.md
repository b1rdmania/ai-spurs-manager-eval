## Comparison to Other Candidates

| Manager | Score | Pressing | Youth Dev | Net Spend | Fan Sentiment | Available |

## Why Spurs Might Hire Him

**Optimistic Case**
1. **Championship pedigree** (Leicester 97 points, promotion at first attempt)
2. **Youth development** aligns with Spurs' academy emphasis
3. **Possession football** appeals to modern playing style
4. **Age 45** — long-term potential (15+ year career runway)
5. **Guardiola connection** — elite coaching education

**Realistic Concerns**
1. **At Chelsea** — would require compensation, board tension
2. **Pressing gap** — PPDA 12.8 vs Spurs' high-intensity needs
3. **Spend dependency** — Chelsea £185m budget unavailable at Spurs
4. **Fan skepticism** — 43% approval suggests questionable mandate
5. **Conference League** is not Premier League elite status

---

## Predicted Outcome at Spurs

### Optimistic Scenario (25% probability)
- Youth pathway flourishes: Devine, Scarlett, Dorrington integrated
- Possession-based football stabilizes mid-table (8th-10th)
- Develops Spurs into "project team" over 3 seasons
- Wins domestic cup by Year 2

### Base Case (60% probability)
- Struggles with pressing intensity demands
- Finishes 7th-9th, misses Champions League
- Fan discontent by Season 2 over lack of trophies
- Sacked after 18-24 months

### Pessimistic Scenario (15% probability)
- Possession football without pressing = mid-table mediocrity
- Spends £100m+ in Year 1, underperforms (6th-8th)
- Dressing room loses patience with tactical rigidity
- Sacked within 12 months

## Spurs-Fit Analysis

### ✅ What Works
- **Youth development** (16% U23 minutes, 8 debuts)
- **Age 45** (long-term appointment potential)
- **Sell-on profit** (€101m demonstrates player trading acumen)
- **Positional football** (modern, attractive style)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work
- **Pressing intensity** (PPDA 12.8 vs Spurs' <9.0 requirement)
- **Net spend dependency** (£185m incompatible with Spurs' value model)
- **Fan backing** (43% approval = fragile mandate)
- **Availability** (at Chelsea, requires compensation/buyout)

---

## Verdict

Enzo Maresca is a **talented possession-coach with strong youth credentials**, but his tactical profile and financial approach clash with Tottenham's needs. His **weak pressing** (PPDA 12.8) undermines Spurs' front-foot philosophy, while his **£185m net spend** contradicts the club's value-creation model.

**For a club seeking aggressive, high-pressing football with fiscal discipline, Maresca is a mismatch.**
**For a club willing to play patient, possession-based football with heavy investment, he's intriguing.**

The model's **48.3/100 score** reflects this: competent enough to avoid disaster, but strategically misaligned for sustained success at Spurs.

If hired, expect beautiful football, strong youth integration, and 7th-9th place finishes — not the Champions League restoration Spurs crave.
