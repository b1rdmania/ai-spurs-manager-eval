Reliable Premier League operator who smashed Fulham's top-flight points record (54). Pressing style, injury control and fan rapport fit Spurs well; limited growth curve and modest attacking creativity lower ceiling.

## 5 Cultural & Board Fit  
London-savvy with low drama profile. Everton board spat historical but isolated incident. Communication style professional and measured - would integrate smoothly with ENIC's preference for stability and media management.

---

## 6 Big-Match Analysis  
25% win rate vs PL top-8 reveals clear tactical limitations against elite opposition. Arsenal tactical adjustments showed learning ability but sample size limited. Lacks knockout competition experience at highest level.

---

## 7 Financial Impact  
ROI ratio 1:0.77 reasonable but not exceptional. Palhinha value appreciation (+£25M) demonstrates ability to develop players. Would maximize mid-tier budget but unclear if ceiling sufficient for top-four ambitions.

---

## 8 Injury & Conditioning  
League-best 93% squad availability demonstrates exceptional fitness management. Strong medical team integration and rotation policies. Clear strength in player welfare and load management systems.

---

## 9 Summary & Recommendation  
Safe, stabilizing option with guaranteed competence in Premier League environment. Ceiling appears limited for top-four aspirations but would provide solid foundation. Excellent fallback candidate if higher-risk appointments deemed unsuitable by board.
