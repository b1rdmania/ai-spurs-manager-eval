## 1 Executive Snapshot  
ROI king: three top-half PL seasons on negative net spend. Data-driven culture dovetails with Spurs' sustainable strategy. Ceiling limited by modest attacking metrics and lower youth pathway than required.

## 4 Spurs-Fit Breakdown  
**Front-Foot Play (20/25)** — PPDA 10.5 meets benchmark, npxGD +0.18 strong, but xG/shot 0.10 just below elite threshold  
**Youth Development (10/25)** — 11% U23 minutes meets minimum, 4 debuts adequate, but lacks academy integration depth  
**Talent Inflation (25/25)** — Exceptional: -£50M net spend with +£120M squad value gain = perfect efficiency  
**Big Games (20/25)** — 50% KO rate meets standard, but Big-8 struggles (2W-5L-3D) indicate ceiling concerns  

**Fit Index: 90.4/100**

**Potential Index: 66.5/100** — Age 51 (0.6 factor), positive trend (0.6), maximum resource leverage (1.0), excellent temperament (0.9)

## 5 Cultural & Board Fit  
Perfect DoF synergy with emphasis on analytics and sustainable recruitment. London life settled, zero history of board conflict. Communication style aligns with modern transparent approach. Would integrate seamlessly with existing football operations structure.

---

## 6 Big-Match Analysis  
2-5-3 vs PL top-8 in 2024-25; tactical plans consistently solid but talent gap became apparent against elite opposition. Set-piece expertise (+0.28 xG/90) provides pathway against bigger teams. Cup run credentials limited but Brentford never had depth for dual campaigns.

---

## 7 Financial Impact  
League-best value per net spend ratio. Track record of selling high (Toney £40M, Raya £27M) and buying undervalued assets. Would maximize every pound of transfer budget while building sustainable squad value. Perfect fit for post-stadium debt strategy.

---

## 8 Injury & Conditioning  
Squad availability 89% demonstrates excellent load management. Uses Smartabase analytics for injury prevention. Strong medical team integration and rotation policies keep players fresh across long seasons.

---

## 9 Summary & Recommendation  
Ideal candidate for sustainable roadmap with guaranteed competence and value delivery. Silverware timeline potentially slower than De Zerbi/Pochettino due to lower attacking ceiling, but risk of failure minimal. Should be present in final interviews as the "safe choice" candidate with proven PL track record.
